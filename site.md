# Bhargava Manja
I'm a recent graduate of [UIUC](http://illinois.edu), where I studied
mathematics and computer science. My research interests are varied, and my goal
is to work on important, hard problems. I am particularly interested in formal
methods of software construction, programming language design/implementation,
robotic learning, and neuroscience inspired approaches to computer vision.
I have conducted research with the [FSL](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu) and the [Bretl
Robotics Group](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/). I currently work at
[Reconstruct](http://reconstructinc.com).

## Not Work
I have recently begun climbing rocks and playing the electric bass. I am
getting back into photography and attempting to reach my pre-undergraduate rate
of book reading.
